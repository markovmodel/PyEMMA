EMMA (Emma's Markov Model Algorithms)
=====================================

What is it?
-----------

This software is a collection of algorithms to analyze trajectories generated
from any kind of simulation (e.g. molecular trajectories) via Markov state models (MSM).

It provides an API for estimation and analyzing MSM and various utilities to
process input data (clustering, coordinate transformations etc). For 
documentation of the API, please have a look at the sphinx docs in doc directory. 


For some examples on how to apply the software, please have a look in the ipython
directory, which shows the most common use cases as documentated IPython notebooks.
