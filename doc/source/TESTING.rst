Testing
=======

You have two possibilities to test emma2:

To run the tests provided in Emma2 you can either use tox, which provides an
isolated testing environment (with all needed dependencies) or you can directly
run single tests from their locations on the command line.

In the emma2 root directory of your repository execute:

::
   python test/testsuite.py
