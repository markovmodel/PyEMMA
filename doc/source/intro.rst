This software is a collection of algorithms implemented mostly in 
`NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ and `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org>`_
to analyze trajectories generated from any kind of simulation
(e.g. molecular trajectories) via Markov state models (MSM).

It provides an API for estimation and analyzing MSM and various utilities to
process input data (clustering, coordinate transformations etc). For documentation
of the API, please have a look at the :ref:`ref_api`.


To install this software and additional dependencies refer to the 
:ref:`Installation Guide <ref_install>`.
