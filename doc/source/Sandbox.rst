ReST Sandbox
============
This sandbox demonstrates various features of the rest markup language that you can 
(and should) use when documenting code.

Format testing
--------------

Fonts
^^^^^

This is *italic*

This is **bold**

This is ``literal``

Bulleted lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* This is a bulleted list.
* It has two items, the second
  item uses two lines.

Numbered lists 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. This is a numbered list.
2. It has two items too.

Numbered lists 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. This is a numbered list.
#. It has two items too.

Nested lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* this is
* a list

  * with a nested list
  * and some subitems

* and here the parent list continues

Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^

term (up to a line of text)
   Definition of the term, which must be indented

   and can even consist of multiple paragraphs

next term
   Description.

Code
^^^^

This is a normal text paragraph. The next paragraph is a code sample::

   It is not processed in any way, except
   that the indentation is removed.

   It can span multiple lines.

This is a normal text paragraph again.

Math testing
------------

Let's write :math:`a^2 + b^2 = c^2` inline

Or as a block

.. math::

   (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

   (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2
