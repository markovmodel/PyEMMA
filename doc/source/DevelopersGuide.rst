Workflow
--------
Have a look at :ref:`Development workflow`.

Python imports
--------------
Relative imports (eg. you are in package A and import other modules
from A) should be avoided due to pylint

Commit messages
---------------

Prepend a tag named [$top_api_package] to commit message, if the files
changed mainly belongs to that api package.

Eg.: ::

      emma2.msm.api.analysis => [msm/analysis]

This has two opportunit√≠es:

1. You know only be looking at a commit message text which package has
been changed and these changes propably has an influence on your
current work.

2. Merged commits from feature branches nicely reintegrate in the
whole bunch of commits from other features in the devel or master
branch (may be filtered very fast).

Else you would have to look at the diff introduced by each commit (or
filter with gitk, which is somehow painful).
