#  Edge routing algorithms.
#  These are mosty helpers for routing an edge 'e' through
#  points pts with various tweaks like moving the starting point
#  to the intersection with the bounding box and taking some constraints
#  into account, and/or moving the head also to its prefered position.
#  Of course, since gandalf only works with bounding boxes, the exact
#  shape of the nodes are not known and the edge drawing inside the bb
#  shall be performed by the drawing engine associated with 'views'.
#  (e.g. look at intersectC when the node shape is a circle)

# Routing with a custom algorithm to round corners
# It works by generating new points up to a distance from where an edge is
# found (and then iteratively refining based on that).
# This is a custom implementation as this interpolation method worked
# well for me where others weren't so great.

# This is the point where it'll start rounding from an edge.
# (can be changed to decide up to which distance it starts
# rounding from an edge).
