class RegularSpaceClustering(AbstractClustering):

    def __init__(self, dmin, max_centers=1000, metric='euclidean'):
        """Clusters data objects in such a way, that cluster centers are at least in
        distance of dmin to each other according to the given metric.
        The assignment of data objects to cluster centers is performed by
        Voronoi partioning.

        Regular space clustering [Prinz_2011]_ is very similar to Hartigan's leader
        algorithm [Hartigan_1975]_. It consists of two passes through
        the data. Initially, the first data point is added to the list of centers.
        For every subsequent data point, if it has a greater distance than dmin from
        every center, it also becomes a center. In the second pass, a Voronoi
        discretization with the computed centers is used to partition the data.


        Parameters
        ----------
        dmin : float
            minimum distance between all clusters.
        metric : str
            metric to use during clustering ('euclidean', 'minRMSD')
        max_centers : int
            if this cutoff is hit during finding the centers,
            the algorithm will abort.
