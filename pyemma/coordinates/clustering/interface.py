        """
        Assigns the given trajectory or list of trajectories to cluster centers by using the discretization defined
        by this clustering method (usually a Voronoi tesselation).

        You can assign multiple times with different strides. The last result of assign will be saved and is available
        as the attribute :func:`dtrajs`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : ndarray(T, n) or list of ndarray(T_i, n), optional, default = None
            Optional input data to map, where T is the number of time steps and n is the number of dimensions.
            When a list is provided they can have differently many time steps, but the number of dimensions need
            to be consistent. When X is not provided, the result of assign is identical to get_output(), i.e. the
            data used for clustering will be assigned. If X is given, the stride argument is not accepted.

        stride : int, optional, default = 1
            If set to 1, all frames of the input data will be assigned. Note that this could cause this calculation
            to be very slow for large data sets. Since molecular dynamics data is usually
            correlated at short timescales, it is often sufficient to obtain the discretization at a longer stride.
            Note that the stride option used to conduct the clustering is independent of the assign stride.
            This argument is only accepted if X is not given.

        Returns
        -------
        Y : ndarray(T, dtype=int) or list of ndarray(T_i, dtype=int)
            The discretized trajectory: int-array with the indexes of the assigned clusters, or list of such int-arrays.
            If called with a list of trajectories, Y will also be a corresponding list of discrete trajectories
