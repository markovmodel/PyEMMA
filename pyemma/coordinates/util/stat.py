def histogram(transform, dimensions, nbins):
    '''Computes the N-dimensional histogram of the transformed data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    transform : pyemma.coordinates.transfrom.Transformer object
        transform that provides the input data
    dimensions : tuple of indices
        indices of the dimensions you want to examine
    nbins : tuple of ints
        number of bins along each dimension

    Returns
    -------
    counts : (bins[0],bins[1],...) ndarray of ints
        counts compatible with pyplot.pcolormesh and pyplot.bar
    edges : list of (bins[i]) ndarrays
        bin edges compatible with pyplot.pcolormesh and pyplot.bar,
        see below.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # doctest: +SKIP

    Only for ipython notebook
    >> %matplotlib inline  # doctest: +SKIP

    >>> counts, edges=histogram(transform, dimensions=(0,1), nbins=(20, 30)) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> plt.pcolormesh(edges[0], edges[1], counts.T) # doctest: +SKIP

    >>> counts, edges=histogram(transform, dimensions=(1,), nbins=(50,)) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> plt.bar(edges[0][:-1], counts, width=edges[0][1:]-edges[0][:-1]) # doctest: +SKIP
