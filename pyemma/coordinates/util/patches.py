def iterload(filename, chunk=100, **kwargs):
    """An iterator over a trajectory from one or more files on disk, in fragments

    This may be more memory efficient than loading an entire trajectory at
    once

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str
        Path to the trajectory file on disk
    chunk : int
        Number of frames to load at once from disk per iteration.  If 0, load all.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    top : {str, Trajectory, Topology}
        Most trajectory formats do not contain topology information. Pass in
        either the path to a RCSB PDB file, a trajectory, or a topology to
        supply this information. This option is not required for the .h5, .lh5,
        and .pdb formats, which already contain topology information.
    stride : int, default=None
        Only read every stride-th frame.
    atom_indices : array_like, optional
        If not none, then read only a subset of the atoms coordinates from the
        file. This may be slightly slower than the standard read because it
        requires an extra copy, but will save memory.

    --------

    Examples
    --------

    >>> import mdtraj as md
    >>> for chunk in md.iterload('output.xtc', top='topology.pdb')
