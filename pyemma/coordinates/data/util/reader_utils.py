    r"""
    Creates a (possibly featured) file reader by a number of input files and either a topology file or a featurizer.
    Parameters
    ----------
    :param input_files:
        A single input file or a list of input files.
    :param topology:
        A topology file. If given, the featurizer argument can be None.
    :param featurizer:
        A featurizer. If given, the topology file can be None.
    :param chunk_size:
        The chunk size with which the corresponding reader gets initialized.
    :return: Returns the reader.
