def frames_from_file(file_name, pdbfile, frames, chunksize=100,
                     verbose=False, stride=1, **kwargs):
    r"""Reads one "file_name" molecular trajectory and returns an mdtraj trajectory object 
        containing only the specified "frames" in the specified order.

    Extracts the specified sequence of time/trajectory indexes from the input loader
    and saves it in a molecular dynamics trajectory. The output format will be determined
    by the outfile name.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_name: str.
        Absolute path to the molecular trajectory file, ex. trajout.xtc 

    pdb_file : str.
        Absolute path to the molecular trajectory file that can be used as topology by mdtraj

    frames : ndarray of shape (n_frames, ) and integer type
        Contains the frame indices to be retrieved from "file_name". There is no restriction as to what 
        this array has to look like other than:
             - positive integers
             - <= the total number of frames in "file_name".
        "frames" need not be monotonous or unique, i.e, arrays like
        [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3000, 0, 0, 1] are welcome 

    verbose: boolean.
        Level of verbosity while looking for "frames". Useful when using "chunksize" with large trajectories.
        It provides the no. of frames accumulated for every chunk.
    stride : int (default=1)
        consider only every n'th frame.

    Returns

           in the order specified in "frames".
