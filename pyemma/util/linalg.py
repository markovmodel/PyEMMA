    Numerically robust solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem of the form

    .. math::
        \mathbf{C}_t \mathbf{r}_i = \mathbf{C}_0 \mathbf{r}_i l_i

    Computes :math:`m` dominant eigenvalues :math:`l_i` and eigenvectors :math:`\mathbf{r}_i`, where
    :math:`m` is the numerical rank of the problem. This is done by first conducting a Schur decomposition
    of the symmetric positive matrix :math:`\mathbf{C}_0`, then truncating its spectrum to retain only eigenvalues
    that are numerically greater than zero, then using this decomposition to define an ordinary eigenvalue
    Problem for :math:`\mathbf{C}_t` of size :math:`m`, and then solving this eigenvalue problem.

    Parameters
    ----------
    C0 : ndarray (n,n)
        time-instantaneous correlation matrix. Must be symmetric positive definite
    Ct : ndarray (n,n)
        time-lagged correlation matrix. Must be symmetric
    epsilon : float
        eigenvalue norm cutoff. Eigenvalues of C0 with norms <= epsilon will be
        cut off. The remaining number of Eigenvalues define the size of
        the output.

    Returns
    -------
    l : ndarray (m)
        The first m generalized eigenvalues, sorted by descending norm
    R : ndarray (n,m)
