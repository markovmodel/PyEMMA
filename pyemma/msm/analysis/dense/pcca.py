def _pcca_connected_isa(evec, n_clusters):
    """
    PCCA+ spectral clustering method using the inner simplex algorithm.
    
    Clusters the first n_cluster eigenvectors of a transition matrix in order to cluster the states.
    This function assumes that the state space is fully connected, i.e. the transition matrix whose
    eigenvectors are used is supposed to have only one eigenvalue 1, and the corresponding first
    eigenvector (evec[:,0]) must be constant.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    eigenvectors : ndarray
        A matrix with the sorted eigenvectors in the columns. The stationary eigenvector should
        be first, then the one to the slowest relaxation process, etc.
    
    n_clusters : int
        Number of clusters to group to.
        
    Returns
    -------
    (chi, rot_mat)
    
    chi : ndarray (n x m)
        A matrix containing the probability or membership of each state to be assigned to each cluster.
        The rows sum to 1.
        
    rot_mat : ndarray (m x m)
        A rotation matrix that rotates the dominant eigenvectors to yield the PCCA memberships, i.e.:
