        r"""A->B reactive flux from transition path theory (TPT)

        This object describes a reactive flux, i.e. a network of fluxes from a set of source states A, to a set of
        sink states B, via a set of intermediate nodes. Every node has three properties: the stationary probability mu,
        the forward committor qplus and the backward committor qminus. Every pair of edges has the following properties:
        a flux, generally a net flux that has no unnecessary back-fluxes, and optionally a gross flux.

        Flux objects can be used to compute transition pathways (and their weights) from A to B, the total flux, the
        total transition rate or mean first passage time, and they can be coarse-grained onto a set discretization
        of the node set.

        Fluxes can be computed in EMMA using transition path theory - see :func:`pyemma.msm.tpt`

        Parameters
        ----------
        A : array_like
            List of integer state labels for set A
        B : array_like
            List of integer state labels for set B
        flux : (n,n) ndarray or scipy sparse matrix
            effective or net flux of A->B pathways
        mu : (n,) ndarray (optional)
            Stationary vector
        qminus : (n,) ndarray (optional)
            Backward committor for A->B reaction
        qplus : (n,) ndarray (optional)
            Forward committor for A-> B reaction
        gross_flux : (n,n) ndarray or scipy sparse matrix
            gross flux of A->B pathways, if available

        Notes
        -----
        Reactive flux contains a flux network from educt states (A) to product states (B).
