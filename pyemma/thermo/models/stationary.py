        Parameters
        ----------
        pi : ndarray(n)
            Stationary distribution. If not already normalized, pi will be
            scaled to fulfill :math:`sum_i pi_i = 1`. The free energies f
            will be computed from pi via :math:`f_i = - \log(\pi_i)`. Only
            if normalize_f is True, a constant will be added to ensure
            consistency with :math:`sum_i pi_i = 1`.
        f : ndarray(n)
            Discrete-state free energies. If normalized_f = True, a constant
            will be added to normalize the stationary distribution. Otherwise
            f is left as given.
        normalize_f : bool, default=True
            If parametrized by free energy f, normalize them such that
            :math:`sum_i pi_i = 1`, which is achieved by :math:`\log \sum_i \exp(-f_i) = 0`.
        label : str, default='ground state'
            Human-readable description for the thermodynamic state of this
            model. May contain a temperature description, such as '300 K' or
            a description of bias energy such as 'unbiased' or 'Umbrella 1'
