The requirements are currently the following:
python >= 2.7
numpy >= 1.6.0
scipy >= 0.13.0
jpype1 >= 0.5.4.5 

For jpype you need a recent JDK (tested on 1.7) installed!

These requirements will be installed automatically, if you use a python package
manager like pip or easy_install.

For all install methods you can prepend '--user' to install to your local user
directory:
 python setup.py install [--user]
 pip install . [--user]
 easy_install [--user] .

It is recommended to upgrade to latest setuptools (2.1) with the provided
script ez_setup.py. Invoke it like that to upgrade:
 python ez_setup.py [--user]
