The requirements are currently the following:
numpy >= 1.7.0
scipy >= 0.13.0
jcc >= 2.17

This requirements will be installed automatically, if you use a python package
manager like pip or easy_install.

For all install methods you can prepend '--user' to install to your local user
directory:
python setup.py install [--user]
pip install . [--user]
easy_install [--user] .

For the stallone wrapper you need a JDK to compile the wrapper code. So far, we
recommend at least JDK 1.6

If you want to update the stallone wrapper module for some reason (updated the
library jars), please call:

# pwd is emma2 project root
REBUILD_STALLONE=y easy_install --user .
