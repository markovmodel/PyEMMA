* (pystallone) recover code to handle python lists as array

* pre cythonized files blow up repo (ugly merge conflicts) - if we just require
  cython in a source install and ship binary packages for users too stupid to 
  provide a sane env, we can just preserve the use of complicated workarounds.
  -> require a stable appveyor build for win
  -> require a stable build for travis (first available when travis provides more mac builders)

  provide binaries:
    for emma, pystallone, jpype:
    conda pipbuild and upload to binstar

* add cythonized c files to .gitattributes and mark them as binary, keeps pain low while merging with git.

* remove output cells of ipython notebooks and unify their history (we do not want to track output).


* machbarkeit modular system?
    * module system (msm package, autobuilder etc) mit eigener versions nr, 
      setup.py, folder.

* direct mem access from py to j does not work as expected. 


final steps:
* packaging (provide wheels)
* move repo to github

future:
-------
* pytables (hdf) project format?
* pymol/vmd vis support (abstraction layer?)
